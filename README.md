## Rules
Let's consider a game of tic-tac-toe with fog of war. 
We have an ordinary tic-tac-toe board, two players and a game server. Players submit motion proposals to the game server (player A does not see player B's proposal and vice versa) 
and the server either accepts this move (if the proposed field is empty), or informs the player that the move is not allowed, and the player has the right to try again (any number of times).
Except that it's a normal tic-tac-toe (i.e. the goal is to arrange 3 of your characters in a row, column or on diagonal).
